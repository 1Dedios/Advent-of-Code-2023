# Day1 Challenge

## Challenge 1st Part:

Simply parse a document and for every line in that document return the first and last numbers and concat them. These numbers represents calibration values. However, if a line only has 1 number that number should be multiplied by 11 to "double the digit". Essentially to be considered a calibration value it must be two digits long.

Once result of parsing the text file is complete. It should return the sum of all of the calibration values.

## Challenge 2nd Part:

Refactor the code that worked above. It should not just read the first and last numerical values. It should also account for numbers that are spelled out. So 'eightwothree', should return 83.
